# Living Style guide

[As Brad Frost says](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-4/#pitching-patterns), "Centralizing UI components in a pattern library establishes a shared vocabulary for everyone in the organization, and creates a more collaborative workflow across all disciplines." That's what this style guide is all about.

This Style Guide demonstrates the styles in [zzzss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zzzss) and uses the React components in [Whippersnapper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/whippersnapper).

## Deployed Living Style Guide
[Is right here](https://living-style-guide.firebaseapp.com/).

## To run the style guide locally
Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Start the dev server:
```
npm start
```
This runs Webpack Dev Server and serves the app at http://localhost:3333/. Makes changes in the code and see the app automatically reload. Magical!


## To build for deployment
```
npm run build
```

And deploy 'build' however you like. [I have a deployed version on Firebase.](https://living-style-guide.firebaseapp.com/)
