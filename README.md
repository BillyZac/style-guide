# Living Style guide

[As Brad Frost says](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-4/#pitching-patterns), "Centralizing UI components in a pattern library establishes a shared vocabulary for everyone in the organization, and creates a more collaborative workflow across all disciplines." That's what this style guide is all about.

This Style Guide demonstrates the styles in [zzzss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zzzss) and uses the React components in [Whippersnapper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/whippersnapper).
